<h2>Remarks</h2>
<h3>Connector Address</h3>
<p>
    Here is an explanation of the ConnectorAddress taken directly from Global Cach&eacute; documentation...
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>
        A connector's address is its position within a module, starting at 1 on the left, and increasing sequentially
        as you move to the right. A complete connector address includes the module address and the connector
        location in the module, separated by a colon. In figure 1 below, one IR module is contained in the iTach
        IP2IR, and is located in module 1. The first IR connector on the IR module has an address of 1:1,
        whereas the third IR connector has an address of 1:3.

<p>GC-100 Network Adapters are addressed in the same manner.</p>

<h3>IR Code</h3>
<p>
    The IRCode is the entire command string that is sent to the Global Cach&eacute; device.  Global Cach&eacute; provides a very helpful database of IR codes that anyone with an email address can access.
    Their website will immediately email you any codes you request.   From that email you should copy the entire code1 string and paste it into the IRCode property of the GCVariable.  The code2 string is an alternate that could also be used.
    The web address for the IR database is <a href="https://irdb.globalcache.com/" target="_blank">https://irdb.globalcache.com/</a>.
