                <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol type="1">
    <li>If you haven't already done so, install the Home Remote app on your target device.  This can be found in the Apple App Store, Google Play, and Windows Store</li>
    <li>Copy the '.hrp' project file to a location accessible on your target device.  This can be done using any method you prefer.<br/>
        Here are some examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Copy it to your target device's local storage.</li>
            <li>Copy it to cloud storage services such as OneDrive or Google Drive.</li>
            <li>Email it to yourself.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Open the file with the Home Remote app.  The Home Remote app is registered to open files with the '.hrp' extension.  In many cases tapping or clicking the file within your file manager app or email client will automatically load the project into the Home Remote app.  This process will clear all data from any previous projects and set the current file as the default project for the app.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>
    Steps 2 and 3 can be repeated as many times as you like.
